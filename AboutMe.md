About ME:
 	I like travelling, walking down the streets, listening songs and watching netflix. One of my favorite things to do is  sitting near the window or balcony and watching the rain. iT gives me peace of mind and relaxation. I always look upto my mom. She was so kind, full of love and I learned everything from her. One thing I cannot live without is food. I would love to meet Actors Jensen Ackles, Hritik Roshan and Singer Taylor Swift. If I could live somewhere I would settle in Silicy, Italy which is an Island and peaceful.
